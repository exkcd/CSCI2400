# CSCI2400

Like the other repos I have created for my computer science classes, this repo is storing essentially the same thing but in C++. For licensing purposes, I cannot include all the lab manual write-ups (also because I'm lazy and I don't want to do that), but the code from the labs is the main bulk of what I want to put in here.

This code will probably have very little application to the real world, but it is nice to save. It will also look quite messy and disorganized as I have very little experience with Git and GitHub, so excuse the chaos.

## Organization

The labs will be organized into chapters, ex. `ch01` and `ch02` with a file called `assignment.md` to explain the problems assigned. This class includes pseudo-code interviews and lab writeups that will help explain the functionality of the code. Each will be labeled according to the corresponding lab, ex. `lab01-writeup.md` and `lab02-writeup.md`.


## About the class

This class is the CSCI2400 Computing Systems class at the University of Colorado Boulder. The book being used is:

*Computing Systems, A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd Edition* by Bryant and O'Halloran
